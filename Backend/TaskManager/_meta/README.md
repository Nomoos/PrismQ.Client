## Issue Workflow

1. **New Issues** → Created in `issues/new/WorkerXX/`
2. **Assignment** → Issue moved to appropriate worker's folder
3. **Work in Progress** → Issue moved to `issues/wip/WorkerXX/`
4. **Completion** → Issue moved to `issues/done/` (no worker subfolders)

## Issue Naming Convention

```
ISSUE-TASKMANAGER-XXX-description.md
```

Where:
- XXX is the issue number (000, 001, 002, etc.)
- description is a brief kebab-case description

## Parallelization

See `PARALLELIZATION_MATRIX.md` for detailed worker dependencies and parallel execution strategy.

## Deployment

The project will be deployed manually by running a PHP deployment script that:
1. Checks out the appropriate branch from GitHub
2. Downloads required scripts and files
3. Sets up the database
4. Configures the environment
5. Validates the installation

See `docs/DEPLOYMENT_SCRIPT.md` for details.
