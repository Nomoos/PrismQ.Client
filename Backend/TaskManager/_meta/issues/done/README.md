# Completed Issues

This directory contains completed and archived TaskManager issues.

Issues are moved here from the wip/ folder when they are fully completed, tested, and approved.

## Archive Structure

Completed issues are stored directly in this folder without worker subdirectories, since the work is complete and worker assignment is no longer relevant.

## File Naming

Files maintain their original names:
- ISSUE-TASKMANAGER-XXX-description.md

## Status

Currently no issues have been completed and archived.
