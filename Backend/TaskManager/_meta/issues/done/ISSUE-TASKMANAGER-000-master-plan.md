# ISSUE-TASKMANAGER-000: TaskManager Implementation Plan

## Status
✅ COMPLETED

## Completion Date
2025-11-07

## Component
Backend/TaskManager (Complete System)

## Type
Epic

## Priority
High

## Description
Master issue tracking the complete implementation of the TaskManager backend system - a lightweight PHP+MySQL task queue designed for shared hosting environments (Vedos).

## Problem Statement
PrismQ needs a task management backend that can run on basic shared hosting (Vedos) without long-running processes. The system must:
- Organize tasks by type (e.g., PrismQ.IdeaInspiration.*, PrismQ.Script.*)
- Validate task parameters using JSON Schema
- Support multiple workers claiming and completing tasks
- Prevent duplicate task creation
- Operate entirely on-demand via HTTP requests
- Minimize caching issues with proper headers
- Handle retry logic for failed tasks

## Solution Overview
Implement a REST API-based TaskManager using:
- **Backend**: PHP 7.4+ (no frameworks, pure PHP for compatibility)
- **Database**: MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.2+
- **Server**: Apache with mod_rewrite
- **Architecture**: Pure on-demand HTTP, no background processes

### System Components
1. **Database Schema**: MySQL tables for task types, tasks, and history
2. **API Endpoints**: REST API for task management
3. **Validation**: JSON Schema validation for parameters
4. **Deduplication**: SHA-256 hash-based duplicate prevention
5. **Documentation**: Complete guides for deployment and usage

## Architecture

### Database Tables
```
task_types (id, name, version, param_schema_json, is_active, timestamps)
tasks (id, type_id, status, params_json, dedupe_key, result_json, error_message, 
       attempts, claimed_by, claimed_at, completed_at, timestamps)
task_history (id, task_id, status_change, worker_id, message, created_at)
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST   /api/task-types/register    - Register task type with schema
GET    /api/task-types/{name}      - Get task type details
GET    /api/task-types             - List all task types

POST   /api/tasks                  - Create task with params
POST   /api/tasks/claim            - Claim task for worker
POST   /api/tasks/{id}/complete    - Complete task with result
GET    /api/tasks/{id}             - Get task status
GET    /api/tasks                  - List tasks (with filters)

GET    /api/health                 - Health check
```

### Task Lifecycle
```
1. Register TaskType → store schema
2. Create Task → validate params → dedupe check → insert
3. Worker Claims → UPDATE status='claimed', lock row
4. Worker Processes → business logic in worker
5. Worker Completes → UPDATE status='completed'/'failed'
6. Retry Logic → if failed + attempts < max → reset to 'pending'
7. Timeout Recovery → reclaim if claimed_at > timeout
```

## Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **No Framework**: Pure PHP for maximum compatibility with shared hosting
2. **No External Dependencies**: Everything self-contained
3. **Simple Schema Validator**: Enough for most cases, avoids composer
4. **Polling Model**: No long-polling or WebSockets (not supported on shared hosting)
5. **Transaction Locking**: Prevents race conditions in task claiming

### Shared Hosting Constraints
- No long-running processes (hence on-demand only)
- Limited PHP execution time (30-60 seconds)
- Limited memory (128-256 MB)
- No composer/dependencies in some cases
- No SSH access in some cases
- Limited cron job frequency

### Lessons Learned
- Keep it simple - shared hosting has many limitations
- Pure PHP works better than frameworks for compatibility
- Proper indexing is critical for query performance
- Transaction locking is essential for claim atomicity
- Cache-Control headers are important for shared hosting
- Documentation is as important as code
