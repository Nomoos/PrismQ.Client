# Archive - Historical Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation, obsolete files, and superseded documents that are kept for reference but are no longer actively used.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**These documents are archived and may be outdated.** Please refer to the current documentation in the parent directories:
- [Getting Started](../getting-started/README.md)
- [Development](../development/README.md)
- [Operations](../operations/README.md)
- [Architecture](../architecture/README.md)

## 📦 Archived Documents

### Historical Implementation Notes
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Historical: On-Demand Architecture implementation notes (completed)
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_MODULE_PATTERN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_MODULE_PATTERN.md)** - Historical: Module pattern implementation (superseded by SINGLE_RESPONSIBILITY_MODULE_PATTERN.md in development/)

### Research & Planning
- **[DEPLOYMENT_RESEARCH.md](DEPLOYMENT_RESEARCH.md)** - Research notes on deployment platforms (completed research)

### Obsolete Documentation
- **[ROOT_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md](ROOT_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md)** - Outdated folder structure documentation
- **[INSTALL_NODEJS_FIRST.md](INSTALL_NODEJS_FIRST.md)** - Redirect document (see NODEJS_INSTALLATION.md in getting-started/)
- **[NODEJS_WINDOWS_QUICKSTART.md](NODEJS_WINDOWS_QUICKSTART.md)** - Windows quickstart (consolidated into NODEJS_INSTALLATION.md)

## 🔍 Why Are These Archived?

### Implementation Summaries
These were created during specific development phases and document completed work. They remain for historical reference but are not needed for current development.

### Duplicate Documentation
Some documents were consolidated:
- Multiple Node.js installation guides merged into one comprehensive guide
- Quick reference guides integrated into main documentation

### Outdated Information
Documents that describe structures or processes that have changed significantly are archived rather than deleted to preserve project history.

## 🗂️ Archive Policy

Documents are archived when:
1. They document completed historical work
2. They have been superseded by newer documentation
3. They contain outdated information that might confuse users
4. They are duplicates that have been consolidated

Archived documents are kept (not deleted) to preserve project history and institutional knowledge.
