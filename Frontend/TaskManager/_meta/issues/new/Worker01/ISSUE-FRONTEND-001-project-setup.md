# ISSUE-FRONTEND-001: Project Setup & Foundation

## Status
🟢 IN PROGRESS

## Component
Frontend (Project Management)

## Type
Planning / Infrastructure

## Priority
Critical

## Assigned To
Worker01 - Project Manager

## Description
Establish the complete Frontend/TaskManager project structure, create all planning documents, define all issues, coordinate worker assignments, and ensure the foundation is ready for parallel development work.

## Problem Statement
The Frontend/TaskManager needs:
- Complete project structure and configuration
- All planning documents (PROJECT_PLAN, PARALLELIZATION_MATRIX, BLOCKERS)
- All issue files created and organized
- Worker directories and coordination system
- MVP strategy and phased approach
- Build and deployment infrastructure

## Solution
Create comprehensive project foundation including:
1. Complete project structure
2. All planning and coordination documents
3. Issue tracking system with all 10 issues
4. Worker coordination framework
5. MVP plan and enhancement roadmap
6. Build configuration and deployment scripts

## Deliverables

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All planning documents complete and up-to-date
- [x] All 10 issue files created
- [x] All worker directories created
- [x] MVP_PLAN.md created with clear strategy
- [x] Project structure complete
- [x] Build system configured and working
- [x] Documentation comprehensive
- [ ] Workers ready to begin Phase 2

## Dependencies
- None (first issue, blocks all others)

## Blocks
- ISSUE-FRONTEND-002 (UX Design) - needs structure
- ISSUE-FRONTEND-003 (API Integration) - needs structure
- ISSUE-FRONTEND-004 (Core Components) - needs structure
- All other issues depend on this foundation

## Current Progress
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ Basic configuration complete
- ✅ Initial planning documents created
- ✅ All issue files created
- ✅ MVP_PLAN.md created
- ✅ All worker directories setup
- ✅ Build system tested and working
- ⏳ Final documentation updates pending

## MVP Strategy
See MVP_PLAN.md for complete MVP approach:
- Phase 0: MVP (minimal but functional)
- Phase 1: Core features
- Phase 2: Enhanced features
- Phase 3: Advanced features

## Timeline
- **Start**: 2025-11-09
- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Target**: End of Week 1
- **Status**: 95% complete - Build system fixed and verified

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All planning documents complete
- ✅ All issues created and organized
- ✅ MVP strategy defined
- ✅ Worker coordination system ready
- ✅ Foundation ready for parallel work

## Notes
- This is the critical path item - all work depends on it
- Priority is to unblock other workers ASAP
- MVP approach allows for quick wins
- Documentation should enable self-service for workers
- Coordination system must support async communication
