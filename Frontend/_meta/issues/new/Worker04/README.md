# Worker04 - Mobile Performance Specialist

## Assignment
**Issue**: ISSUE-FRONTEND-005 - Performance Optimization

## Specialization
- Mobile performance optimization
- Vite build configuration
- Bundle size optimization
- 3G network performance
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

## Responsibilities
- Optimize bundle size (<500KB target)
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Setup service worker for caching
- Optimize images and assets
- Configure performance budgets
- Test on 3G network conditions
- Lighthouse mobile optimization

## Key Deliverables
1. Vite build optimization
2. Code splitting strategy
3. Lazy loading for routes and components
4. Image optimization pipeline
5. Service worker implementation
6. Performance budgets and monitoring
7. Lighthouse CI integration
8. 3G testing reports

## Dependencies
- **Blocked By**: ISSUE-FRONTEND-004 (Core Components) - needs components to optimize
- **Works With**: Worker03 (Core Components) - for optimization opportunities
- **Independent**: Can setup infrastructure early

## Timeline
- **Phase**: Phase 2 (Week 2)
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Can Start Early**: Yes - infrastructure setup

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Initial bundle <500KB (gzipped)
- ✅ Load time <3s on 3G
- ✅ Lighthouse mobile score >90
- ✅ FCP <2s, TTI <5s, LCP <3s
- ✅ Service worker caching working
- ✅ Performance budgets enforced

## Status
🔴 NOT STARTED - Can begin infrastructure setup anytime
